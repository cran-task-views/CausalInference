### Overview

Causal inference can be seen as a subfield of statistical analysis. It
is used in various fields such as econometrics, epidemiology,
educational sciences, etc. With causal inference one addresses questions
about effects of a treatment, intervention, or policy on some target over
a given sample or population. Under certain identifiability and model assumptions, causal
inference can be carried out by fitting simple regression models or
combining several regression models in a specific way as will be
sketched out later. For observational data, additional untestable
assumptions have to be made to (non-parametrically) identify causal
effects.

There are no basic R functions that are direct implementations of standard causal
inference designs, but many methods - more or less complex - are implemented in
different packages on CRAN, which we structure into main topics:

- [Methods for experimental data](#rct)
- [Average treatment effect estimation and other univariate treatment effect estimates](#ate)
- [Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation](#hte)
- [Policy learning and dynamic treatment regimes](#policy)
- [Structural equation models (SEM), do-calculus causal discovery](#dag)
- [Specific types of data](#data)
- [Specific application fields](#applications)

Certain causal inference methods originated in specific fields such as
econometrics or clinical trials and remain most popular therein. In certain
cases, we therefore refer to other task views covering these methods in more
depth. More generally, in this task view we focus on causal analyses with
observational data.

If you think that we missed some important packages in this list, please
contact the maintainers.

    `r pkg("blocksdesign")` (blocks for general factorial
    treatment designs), `r pkg("BCHM")` (Bayesian cluster
    hierarchical model design for multiple subgroup basket trials),
    `r pkg("Boptbd")` (Bayesian optimal block designs under
    linear mixed effects model), `r pkg("seqDesign")`
    (sequential design of randomized two-stage treatment efficacy trials
    with time-to-event endpoints). Many other tools and packages exist
    for designing experiments and clinical trials, we refer to the
    `r view("ExperimentalDesign")` and
    `r view("ClinicalTrials")` CRAN Task Views.

    (various statistical methods), `r pkg("eefAnalytics")`
    (Frequentist and Bayesian multilevel models),
    `r pkg("ipcwswitch")` (IPW adapted to treatment switch in

    two-armed randomised control trial where non-compliance exists and
    is measured, under an assumption of an accelerated failure time
    model and no unmeasured confounders.

    causal dose response functions), `r pkg("hdm")` (efficient
    estimators with uniformly valid confidence intervals, it assumes
    approximately sparse models for high-dimensional settings). Estimation in
    *fixed effects designs* is possible through `r pkg("fixest")` (linear and
    generalized linear fixed effects models and combined with instrumental
    variables), `r pkg("plm")` (for panel data), and `r pkg("alpaca")` (for

    for time-varying treatment and confounding),
    `r pkg("EffectLiteR")` (based on structural equation
    modeling), `r pkg("endoSwitch")` (maximum likelihood
    estimation of endogenous switching regression models), and
    `r pkg("riskRegression", priority = "core")` (for survival
    outcomes with or without competing risks). For parametric models, g-computation is the same as estimating average marginal effects, which can be achieved using `r pkg("margins")`, `r pkg("marginaleffects")`, `r pkg("modelbased")`, and `r pkg("stdReg")`.
-   *Matching* methods are implemented in `r pkg("MatchIt", priority = "core")`, which provides wrappers for a number of popular methods including propensity score matching and subclassification, (coarsened) exact matching, full matching, and cardinality matching; more specialized matching methods are implemented in some of the packages below, some of which MatchIt depends on. `r pkg("MatchThem")` provides a wrapper for MatchIt with multiply-imputed data. `r pkg("Matching", priority = "core")` performs nearest neighbor and genetic matching and implements Abadie and Imbens-style matching imputation estimators. `r pkg("optmatch")` performs optimal matching using network flows; several other packages rely on the same infrastructure, including `r pkg("DiPs")` (near-fine matching with directional penalties), `r pkg("matchMulti")` (optimal matching for clustered data), `r pkg("rcbalance")` and `r pkg("rcbsubset")` (optimal matching for refined balance), `r pkg("approxmatch")` (near-optimal matching for multi-category treatments), and `r pkg("match2C")` (optimal matching using two criteria). Other packages include `r pkg("cem")` (coarsened exact matching), `r pkg("designmatch")` (optimization-based matching using mixed integer programming), `r pkg("stratamatch")` (matching and stratification in large datasets), `r pkg("FLAME")` (almost-matching-exactly via learned weighted Hamming distance), `r pkg("PanelMatch")` (matching with time-series cross-sectional data), and `r pkg("CausalGPS")` (generalized propensity score matching for continuous treatments).

Several packages offer specialized methods of estimating balancing weights for various treatment types, which may or may not involve a propensity score: `r pkg("CBPS")` (generalized method of moments-based propensity score estimation for binary, multi-category, continuous, and longitudinal treatments), `r pkg("twang")` and `r pkg("twangContinuous")` (propensity score weighting using gradient boosting machines for binary, multi-category, continuous, and longitudinal treatments), `r pkg("sbw")` and `r pkg("optweight")` (optimization-based weights using quadratic programming), and `r pkg("ebal")` (entropy balancing). `r pkg("mvGPS")` estimates weights for multivariate treatments using WeightIt's infrastructure. *Matching-adjusted indirect comparison*, a relative of propensity score weighting when unit-level data is only available for some groups, is available in `r pkg("maic")`, `r pkg("maicChecks")`, and `r pkg("optweight")` (using the `optweight.svy()` function).

Augmented IPW (AIPW) is implemented in `r pkg("AIPW")`, `r pkg("PSweight")`, `r pkg("DoubleML")`, `r pkg("grf")` (functions `causal_forest` followed by `average_causal_effect`), and `r pkg("causalweight")`. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE, also known as targeted minimum loss-based estimation) is available in `r pkg("drtmle")`, `r pkg("tmle", priority = "core")`, `r pkg("ctmle")` (for TMLE with variable selection), `r pkg("ltmle")` (for longitudinal data), and `r pkg("AIPW")`.

    `r pkg("grf")`, `r pkg("fixest")`, `r pkg("estimatr")`, and
    `r pkg("DoubleML")` (function `DoubleMLIIVM`).
    `r pkg("ivmte")` provides a choice-theoretic
    interpretation to IV models using *Marginal Treatment Effects* to
    extrapolate from the compliers to estimate treatment effects for
    other subpopulations. `r pkg("LARF")` uses
    Local Average Response Functions for IV estimation of treatment

    interaction term. `r pkg("gma")` performs Granger
    mediation analysis for time series. `r pkg("bmem")` provides several different
    methods for mediation analysis in the case of missing data (listwise/pairwise 
    deletion, multiple imputation, two stage maximum likelihood) and power analysis 
    for mediation analysis.

`r pkg("confoundr")` implements covariate-balance diagnostics
for time-varying confounding. `r pkg("WhatIf")` offers methods to assess overlap and extrapolation.

### [Heterogeneous treatment effect estimation]{#hte}

Some of the above mentioned packages can also be used for heterogeneous
treatment effect (HTE) estimation.

-   *Bayesian approaches* for individual causal effect estimation are
    available in several packages including
    `r pkg("bartCause")` (based on Bayesian Additive
    Regression Trees) and `r pkg("bcf")` (Bayesian Causal
    Forest).

    treatment strategy and identify important variables for either
    censored or uncensored continuous response. `r pkg("DTRlearn2")` offers

    via penalization.
-   *For sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials (SMART)*,
    `r pkg("smartsizer")` provides a set of tools for determining the necessary

    interventional data without hidden variables;
    `r pkg("pcalg")` also allows to do *causal
    inference using graphical models* (the IDA algorithm, the Generalized
    Backdoor Criterion - GBC, the Generalized Adjustment Criterion - GAC).
    Incorporating background knowledge is also possible. Many algorithms and
    methods for general and specific graphical models exist, we refer to the
    `r view("GraphicalModels")` and `r view("Psychometrics")` CRAN Task Views
    for a comprehensive overview.
-   *Estimation of causal effects* is possible in
